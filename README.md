# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to predict medical insurance charges based on individual attributes such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children.  
The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate insurance costs and identify the most influential factors affecting medical expenses.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

- **age** – Age of the individual
- **sex** – Gender
- **bmi** – Body Mass Index
- **children** – Number of dependents
- **smoker** – Smoking status
- **region** – Residential region
- **charges** – Medical insurance cost (Target Variable)

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To develop a machine learning model that predicts medical insurance charges and evaluate its performance using regression metrics.

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis of numerical features
- Correlation heatmap
- Impact of smoking on insurance charges
- BMI vs Charges relationship
- Actual vs Predicted visualization

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Random Forest showed better performance compared to Linear Regression.

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Smoking significantly increases medical insurance charges.
- Higher BMI tends to increase insurance costs.
- Age is positively correlated with medical expenses.
- Random Forest model captures non-linear relationships better.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model deployment using Streamlit
- Feature engineering for improved accuracy
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
