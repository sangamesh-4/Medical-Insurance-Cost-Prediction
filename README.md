Medical Insurance Cost Prediction 🏥
Project Overview

This project performs data analysis and builds machine learning models to predict medical insurance charges based on individual attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.

Dataset

Medical Insurance Dataset

Features include:
Age, Gender, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, Charges

Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Key Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Correlation analysis

Smoking impact on insurance charges

BMI vs Charges relationship

Age vs Charges trend analysis

Actual vs Predicted visualization

Machine Learning Models

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Random Forest performed better compared to Linear Regression.

Key Insights

Smoking significantly increases insurance costs

Higher BMI leads to higher charges

Age positively influences medical expenses

Tree-based models capture non-linear patterns effectively

Conclusion

This project strengthened my understanding of exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and performance evaluation techniques in machine learning.
